# drumr

An app for finding and curating a list of your favorite drummers

### Origin story

This project comes from a life-long passion for drumming and all percussive things.
The original project was limited in scope and built in about two weeks while I was a front-end engineering
student at The Iron Yard-Austin under the tutelage of Aaron Larner.

### Rewrite/Refactor

This re-write is an attempt to recreate it with more current libraries and (hopefully) less code. :bowtie:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It rules. You should use it. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
